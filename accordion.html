					<h3>Why use an Accordion?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Accordions can condense a list of terms and/or concepts into a smaller area.</li>
						<li>Accordions isolate each concept and it's explanation or definition, aiding retention.</li>
						<li>Terms, definitions and frequently asked questions are perfect for an accordion.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Why <span class="underline">not</span> an Accordion?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Your terms are long and wrap to multiple lines.</li>
						<li>Your definitions are fairly long, requiring significant scrolling.</li>
						<li>You have less than 4 term/definition pairs.</li>
						<li>The learner is expected to compare or contrast terms.</li>
						<li>Accordions themselves are lists &amp; so they should not contain lists themselves.</li>

						<dd class="accordion-panel" aria-hidden="true">
							<p>Confirmation bias, also called myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People
								display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous
								evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence),
								belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive
								an association between two events or situations).</p>

						<dt class="accordion-tab">Choice-supportive bias</dt>
						<dd class="accordion-panel" aria-hidden="true">
							<p>In cognitive science, choice-supportive bias is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected. It is a cognitive bias. For example, if a person buys a computer from Apple instead of a computer (PC) running
								Windows, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of Apple computers while amplifying those of Windows computers. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify advantages of Apple computers and not notice or de-emphasize those
								of Windows computers.</p>

							<p>What is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences. Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields memories that
								tend to be distorted in predictable ways. In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were
								part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options. Once an action has been taken, the ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of what we did may be biased. It is believed this may influence our future
								decision-making. These biases may be stored as memories, which are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context. True
								and false memories arise by the same mechanism because when the brain processes and stores information, it cannot tell the difference from where they came from.</p>

						<dt class="accordion-tab">Dunning–Kruger effect</dt>
						<dd class="accordion-panel" aria-hidden="true">
							<p>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others.</p>
							<p>As David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University conclude:</p>
							<p><q>The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.</q></p>
