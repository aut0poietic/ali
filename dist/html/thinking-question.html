			<h3>Cognitive Bias Modification</h3>
			<p>Cognitive bias modification refers to the process of modifying cognitive biases in healthy people and also
				refers to a growing area of psychological (non-pharmaceutical) therapies for anxiety, depression and
				addiction called cognitive bias modification therapy (CBMT).</p>
			<p>CBMT is sub-group of therapies within a growing area of psychological therapies based on modifying
				cognitive processes with or without accompanying medication and talk therapy, sometimes referred to as
				applied cognitive processing therapies (ACPT). Although cognitive bias modification can refer to modifying
				cognitive processes in healthy individuals, CBMT is a growing area of evidence-based psychological therapy,
				in which cognitive processes are modified to relieve suffering from serious depression,anxiety, and addiction.</p>
			<p>CBMT techniques are technology assisted therapies that are delivered via a computer with or without
				clinician support. CBM combines evidence and theory from the cognitive model of anxiety, cognitive
				neuroscience, and attentional models.</p>
