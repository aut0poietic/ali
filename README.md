# Ali - Accessible Learning Interactions

**Ali** is a set of learning interactions for delivery in any 
 eLearning platform that supports HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

The guiding requirements for the project are:

1. Accessibility: Every component complies with WCAG AA or better and 
 ARIA is used to appropriately indicate functionality and state.
2. Responsive: While the primary target is Desktop and Tablet devices,
 every component works on smaller screens.
3. Reusable: Configuration of a component is handled in HTML. While
 custom themes require knowledge of CSS (or SASS), use of the
 components require only a general understanding of HTML.
 
The current designs use a fairly generic "material" appearance and 
 are loosely patterned after Twitter's Bootstrap (and the examples use 
 Bootstrap ). However, there are no specific requirements spare jQuery
 (for now).
 
Please see the issues page for a list of interactions, features, and base
 designs.
