# Ali - Accessible Learning Interactions

**Ali** is a set of learning interactions for delivery in any 
 eLearning platform that supports HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

The guiding requirements for the project are:

1. Accessibility: Every component complies with WCAG AA or better and ARIA is used to appropriately indicate 
 functionality and state.
2. Responsive: While the primary target is Desktop and Tablet devices, every component works on smaller screens.
3. Reusable: Configuration of a component is handled in HTML. While custom themes require knowledge of CSS (or SASS), 
 basic use of the components require only a general understanding of HTML.

The interactions design is fairly generic, but the forms are loosely based on
 [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
 guidelines. The styles themselves are generic and ready for your custom styles. 
 
The components currently require [jQuery 2.x](https://code.jquery.com). Future iterations
 of the components may remove this requirement. 

Learners utilizing the components require a modern browser (last 4 versions), IE 10+ and any version of Edge.
